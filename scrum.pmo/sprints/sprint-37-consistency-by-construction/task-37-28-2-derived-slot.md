## Task Description

Per-class freshness guard for the derived-slot artifact-class (R37.25 truth-decay / no-freshness-invariant family; architect design ior:file:scrum.pmo/design-notes/design-truth-decay-freshness-invariant-family.md?commit=e31458f92). CURE = derive-first ELSE stored-with-revalidation+visible-stale; never stored-and-silent. This subtask builds the FAILABLE gate for this class (stub-must-fail). Family coord-root: Task 37.28.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] (functional) derived-slot (NEXT/CURRENT): (a) DERIVE from single source; DROP stored overrides. Specimen: fact-2 nextBacklogOverride (46c68e1fc) = a stored NEXT that rots; cured by derive-dont-store. CITES fact-2 fix; does not duplicate.
- [ ] (gate) STUB-MUST-FAIL + 3-LINK CREDIT: a satisfaction credited via this gate needs THREE resolvable links — (1) resolvable satisfyingGate CITE, (2) GREEN-on-HEAD, (3) ASSERTS-THIS-AC (scope-match not name-match). Links 2+3 = the TESTER verdict (proof-builder separation; planner/req/architect may NOT self-credit). Bite: cite-only+gate-RED-on-HEAD => uncredited; gate-green-but-asserts-a-DIFFERENT-AC (name-match) => uncredited. FAMILY: truth-decay / no-freshness-invariant.

## Subtasks

None (leaf subtask).
